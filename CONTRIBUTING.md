### Build
To install build dependencies, run ```npm install```.

Run webpack with ```npm run build```. Built files can be found in the ```dist/``` directory.

### Test

The project is configured with webpack-dev-server. You can run ```npm run dev``` to start the dev server. This will build the plugin, watch the source for changes, and serve up the example ```index.html``` file in a local webserver. You can access this by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in a browser. As you make changes to the source, the local served content will be refreshed automatically.
